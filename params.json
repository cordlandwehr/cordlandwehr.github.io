Using this simulator, one can easily test and develop graph algorithms. It is especially suited to teach algorithm courses but as well in research when experimenting with algorithms in a drafting stage. From the software development point of view, the most interesting aspects are:\r\n* the visual editor, which consists of a QtQuickView and integrates into the QtWidget based application\r\n* the scripting engine, which propagates the graph and its elements to a JavaScript engine\r\n* the graph document backend, which is a non-trivial example of a Qt class hierarchies with complex interactions\r\n(note: main repository at git.kde.org)\r\n\r\n### [Artikulate](https://github.com/KDE/artikulate)\r\nArtikulate is a pronunciation trainer for perfecting your diction skills. It implements a learning process by repeated self-assessment and -adjustment. From the software development point of view, the most interesting aspects are:\r\n* it's a non-trivial Qt application that is a hybrid of a QtQuick frontend and a C++ backend\r\n* for recording and playing, the main sound backend is GStreamer (usued via QtGStreamer)\r\n\r\n## Contributions to Research Projects\r\n* \r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n+ see full list at [Scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vhfQ-hkAAAAJ)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
