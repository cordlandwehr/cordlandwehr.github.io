Using this simulator, one can easily test and develop graph algorithms. It is especially suited to teach algorithm courses but as well in research when experimenting with algorithms in a drafting stage. From the software development point of view, the most interesting aspects are:\r\n* the visual editor, which consists of a QtQuickView and integrates into the QtWidget based application\r\n* the scripting engine, which propagates the graph and its elements to a JavaScript engine\r\n* the graph document backend, which is a non-trivial example of a Qt class hierarchies with complex interactions\r\n\r\n(GitHub is a mere project mirror, the main repository is at [git.kde.org](https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=rocs.git))\r\n\r\n### [Artikulate](https://github.com/KDE/artikulate)\r\nArtikulate is a pronunciation trainer for perfecting your diction skills. It implements a learning process by repeated self-assessment and -adjustment. From the software development point of view, the most interesting aspects are:\r\n* it's a hybrid C++/QtQuick application, consisting of a QtQuick frontend and a C++ backend\r\n* for recording and playing, the sound backend is GStreamer (usued via QtGStreamer)\r\n\r\n(GitHub is a mere project mirror, the main repository is at [git.kde.org](https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=artikulate.git))\r\n\r\n### [KDE on Android SDK](https://phabricator.kde.org/diffusion/ANDROIDBUILDER/)\r\nDocker image that provides a self-contained cross-building environment for building Qt/KF5 applications for Android.\r\n\r\n## Selected Contributions to Research Projects\r\n### [Robot-Swarm-Simulator](https://github.com/cordlandwehr/robotswarmsimulator)\r\nA versatile and scalable simulator for 3D particle swarms that consist of autonomous agents, each individually performing local operations. The simulator was used for groundwork for the following two publications:\r\n* \"Collisionless gathering of robots with an extent\", SOFSEM 2011\r\n* \"A new approach for analyzing convergence algorithms for mobile robots\", ICALP 2011\r\n\r\n# Scientific Portfolio\r\n* for a comprehensive overview of my publications please consult [Scholar.Google.com](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vhfQ-hkAAAAJ)\r\n\r\n## Selected Publications\r\n* A.
